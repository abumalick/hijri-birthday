## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hijri-birthday.git
    cd hijri-birthday
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, run the following command:

```sh
bun run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `dist` directory that you can deploy to any static hosting service.

## üß™ Running Tests

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```sh
bun run test
```

## üé® Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for a beautiful, pre-built component library.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is structured as a standard Vite + React application:

- `src/routes/`: Contains the application's routes, powered by [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router).
- `src/services/`: Includes data storage logic. The `LocalStorageService` can be swapped with other storage solutions (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) by implementing the `StorageService` interface.
- `src/utils/`: Contains utility functions, primarily for date calculations.
- `src/styles.css`: Main stylesheet where Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI are imported.
